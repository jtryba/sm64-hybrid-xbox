# SM64 Hybrid Xbox

> **Hybrid Shindou/Raphnet lineage for the original Xbox.**
>
> This repository is the independent `SM64-HYBRID-XBOX` project. It contains the hybrid Shindou-rumble path, Raphnet v3 N64-controller and Rumble Pak support, and the hardware-qualified initialization/cleanup work.
>
> The enhanced-vanilla / clean-upstream-PR lineage is maintained separately in [`jtryba/sm64-port`](https://github.com/jtryba/sm64-port). Build, runtime, hardware, and publication acceptance do not transfer between these repositories.

# Super Mario 64 Port

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J), (U), and (E) with minor exceptions in the audio subsystem.
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures are in progress.
- Efforts to decompile the Shindou ROM steadily advance toward a matching build.
- Beyond Nintendo 64, it can also target Linux and Windows natively.

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the game.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the assets.

## Building Xbox executables

The Xbox port is still early in development. Expect issues.

The port uses NXDK and XGU, which are present in the repo as submodules, so you don't need to install them separately.

On XQEMU and XEMU some depth buffer-related issues are present. These do not seem to exist on real hardware.

Some rendering- and filesystem-related stuff I only figured out thanks to [this Xbox renderer implementation](https://github.com/mborgerson/xsm64).

### Using Docker

0. Ensure Git and Docker are installed on your system.
1. Check out repo, submodules, etc:
```
git clone https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/sm64-port.git -b xbox --recursive sm64-port-xbox
cd sm64-port-xbox
```
2. Copy in your baserom.XX.z64: `cp /path/to/baserom.us.z64 .`
3. Build Docker image: `docker build . -t sm64_xbox`
4. Compile using your Docker image: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/sm64 sm64_xbox make --jobs`

Alternatively instead of steps 3 and 4 you can use a prebuilt Docker image provided by mkst:

```docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/sm64 markstreet/sm64:xbox make --jobs```

### Manually under Windows and Linux

0. [Install prerequisites](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Install-the-Prerequisites) for NXDK.
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/sm64-port.git -b xbox sm64-xbox`
2. Copy your SM64 ROM into the `sm64-xbox` directory, rename it to `baserom.us.z64` (`baserom.eu.z64` or `baserom.jp.z64` for other regions).
3. `cd sm64-xbox && make -j4`

In both cases you can find the resulting PBE file at `build/<VERSION>_xbox/out/default.pbe`.
The build process also produces an Xbox ISO called `sm64.iso` in the root repo directory.

## Building native executables

### Linux

1. Install prerequisites (Ubuntu): `sudo apt install -y git build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libsdl2-dev`.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port.git`, which will create a directory `sm64-port` and then **enter** it `cd sm64-port`.
3. Place a Super Mario 64 ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the repository's root directory for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
4. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).
5. The executable binary will be located at `build/<VERSION>_pc/sm64.<VERSION>.f3dex2e`.

### Windows

1. Install and update MSYS2, following all the directions listed on https://www.msys2.org/.
2. From the start menu, launch MSYS2 MinGW and install required packages depending on your machine (do **NOT** launch "MSYS2 MSYS"):
  * 64-bit: Launch "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" and install: `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`
  * 32-bit (will also work on 64-bit machines): Launch "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" and install: `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-i686-gcc`
  * Do **NOT** by mistake install the package called simply `gcc`.
3. The MSYS2 terminal has a _current working directory_ that initially is `C:\msys64\home\<username>` (home directory). At the prompt, you will see the current working directory in yellow. `~` is an alias for the home directory. You can change the current working directory to `My Documents` by entering `cd /c/Users/<username>/Documents`.
4. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port.git`, which will create a directory `sm64-port` and then **enter** it `cd sm64-port`.
5. Place a *Super Mario 64* ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the repository's root directory for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
6. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).
7. The executable binary will be located at `build/<VERSION>_pc/sm64.<VERSION>.f3dex2e.exe` inside the repository.

#### Troubleshooting

1. If you get `make: gcc: command not found` or `make: gcc: No such file or directory` although the packages did successfully install, you probably launched the wrong MSYS2. Read the instructions again. The terminal prompt should contain "MINGW32" or "MINGW64" in purple text, and **NOT** "MSYS".
2. If you get `Failed to open baserom.us.z64!` you failed to place the baserom in the repository. You can write `ls` to list the files in the current working directory. If you are in the `sm64-port` directory, make sure you see it here.
3. If you get `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.`, you are not in the correct directory. Make sure the yellow text in the terminal ends with `sm64-port`. Use `cd <dir>` to enter the correct directory. If you write `ls` you should see all the project files, including `Makefile` if everything is correct.
4. If you get any error, be sure MSYS2 packages are up to date by executing `pacman -Syu` and `pacman -Su`. If the MSYS2 window closes immediately after opening it, restart your computer.
5. When you execute `gcc -v`, be sure you see `Target: i686-w64-mingw32` or `Target: x86_64-w64-mingw32`. If you see `Target: x86_64-pc-msys`, you either opened the wrong MSYS start menu entry or installed the incorrect gcc package.

### Debugging

The code can be debugged using `gdb`. On Linux install the `gdb` package and execute `gdb <executable>`. On MSYS2 install by executing `pacman -S winpty gdb` and execute `winpty gdb <executable>`. The `winpty` program makes sure the keyboard works correctly in the terminal. Also consider changing the `-mwindows` compile flag to `-mconsole` to be able to see stdout/stderr as well as be able to press Ctrl+C to interrupt the program. In the Makefile, make sure you compile the sources using `-g` rather than `-O2` to include debugging symbols. See any online tutorial for how to use gdb.

## ROM building

It is possible to build N64 ROMs as well with this repository. See https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64 for instructions.
